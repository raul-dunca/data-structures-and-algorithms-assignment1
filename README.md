# Problem
Implement  in  C++  the  given container(`ADT`)  using  a given  representation  and  a **dynamic  array** as a data structure. You are not allowed to use the vector from STL or from any other library.
- ADT Matrix – represented as a sparse matrix, using a dynamicarray of triples <line, column, value>  (value ≠0),  ordered  lexicographically  considering  the  <line,  column>  of  every element.
